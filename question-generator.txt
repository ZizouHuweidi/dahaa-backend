Generate {num_questions} questions about {category}.
For each question, provide:
1. A clear, concise question text
2. A single correct answer (factually accurate)
3. {num_fillers} incorrect but plausible filler answers

Important guidelines:
- Questions should be factually accurate and verifiable
- Avoid opinion-based questions
- Ensure answers are not too similar to each other
- Keep questions and answers concise
- Format filler_answers as a JSON array of strings

Format the response as a JSON array of objects with this exact structure:
[
  {
    "text": "What is the capital of France?",
    "answer": "Paris",
    "filler_answers": ["London", "Berlin", "Madrid"]
  }
]

ONLY return the JSON array, no other text or markdown formatting.
